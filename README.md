# reflector
Awesome plugin to Sublime Text 2 to mirror text and write form right to left.

Try it!
Open a file and then a terminal in Sublime Text 2, paste this:
  view.run_command('example')
and watch your code going backwards.
Please, contribute all you want. Add some new characters and its mirror to criteria.py and reflector will apply its magic on them instead of giving an exception.
